# Parking API

## Architecture 

This is a RESTful API which follows N-layer architecture and ddd.
It maybe sounds like over engineering for a small API like this, but I tried to simulate my day to day work as possible.

### How to run

1. Make sure that mongodb is installed and running on your machine. ( latest version preferred )
2. `npm install` in the root dir of the project.
3. Make sure you add env variables which exist in `.env.example`.
4. `npm run start` || `npm run dev` ( node || nodemon ).
